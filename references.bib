This preliminary partitioning provides a global view on the sentences relations existing in the text, considering the similarities in a group rather than individually. ClassStruggle is based on the distribution of the occurrences of the members of each class. During the process, the clusters then evolve, by considering a notion of proximity and of layout in the text, in the aim to create groups that contain only sentences related to a same topic development. Finally, boundaries are created between sentences belonging to two different classes. First experimental results are promising, ClassStruggle appears to be very competitive compared with existing methods.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing}, pages = {600–604}, numpages = {5}, keywords = {clustering, text segmentation}, location = {Seoul, Korea}, series = {SAC '07} }

Traditional methods rely on representing text documents using the simple Bag-of-Words (BOW) model. A document is an organized structure consisting of various text segments or passages. Such single term analysis of the text treats whole document as a single semantic unit and thus, ignores other semantic units like sentences, passages etc. In this paper, we attempt to take advantage of underlying subtopic structure of text documents and investigate whether clustering of text documents can be improved if text segments of two documents are utilized, while calculating similarity between them. We concentrate on examining effects of combining suggested inter-document similarities (based on inter-passage similarities) with traditional inter-document similarities following a simple approach for the same. Experimental results on standard data sets suggest improvement in clustering of text documents.",

To search for the weakest point, we apply two different measures: one is based on language modeling of text segmentation and the other, on the interconnectivity between two segments. Our solution produces a deep and narrow binary tree - a dynamic object that describes the structure of a text and that is fully adaptable to a user's segmentation needs. We treat it as a separate task to flatten the tree into a broad and shallow hierarchy either through supervised learning of a document set or explicit input of how a text should be segmented. The rich structure of our created tree further allows us to segment documents at varying levels such as topic, sub-topic, etc. We evaluated our new solution on a set of 265 articles from Discover magazine where the topic structures are unknown and need to be discovered. Our experimental results show that the iterative approach has the potential to generate better segmentation results than several leading baselines, and the separate flattening step allows us to adapt the results to different levels of details and user preferences.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 33rd European Conference on Advances in Information Retrieval}, pages = {629–640}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {language modeling, text segmentation}, location = {Dublin, Ireland}, series = {ECIR'11} }

In support of joint training, we develop a method for teaching the model to recover from errors by aligning the predicted and ground truth segments. We show that S-LSTM reduces segmentation error by 30{\%} on average, while also improving segment labeling.",

Though the task of automatic web page segmentation was introduced two decades ago, along with several applications in web content analysis, its foundations are still lacking. Specifically, the developed evaluation methods and datasets presume a certain downstream task, which led to a variety of incompatible datasets and evaluation methods. To address this shortcoming, we contribute two resources: (1) An evaluation framework which can be adjusted to downstream tasks by measuring the segmentation similarity regarding visual, structural, and textual elements, and which includes measures for annotator agreement, segmentation quality, and an algorithm for segmentation fusion. (2) The Webis-WebSeg-20 dataset, comprising 42,450~crowdsourced segmentations for 8,490~web pages, outranging existing sources by an order of magnitude. Our results help to better understand the "mental segmentation model'' of human annotators: Among other things we find that annotators mostly agree on segmentations for all kinds of web page elements (visual, structural, and textual). Disagreement exists mostly regarding the right level of granularity, indicating a general agreement on the visual structure of web pages.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information \& Knowledge Management}, pages = {3047–3054}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {evaluation, crowdsourcing, webpage segmentation, web page segmentation, segmentation}, location = {Virtual Event, Ireland}, series = {CIKM '20} }
